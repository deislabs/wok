# Contributing Guide

This document describes the requirements for committing to this repository.

## Code of Conduct

All participants in the Wok community must comply with the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). This includes issues filed in the queue as well as PRs.

## Contributor License Agreement

This repository is governed under a [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/oam-dev/spec?pullRequest=218). All PR submitters must accept the CLA before their contributions can be merged.

## Pull Request Management

All code that is contributed to Wok must go through the Pull Request (PR) process. To contribute a PR, fork this project, create a new branch, make changes on that branch, and then use GitHub to open a pull request with your changes.

Every PR must be reviewed by at least one Core Maintainer of the project. Once a PR has been marked "Approved" by a Core Maintainer (and no other core maintainer has an open "Rejected" vote), the PR may be merged. While it is fine for non-maintainers to contribute their own code reviews, those reviews do not satisfy the above requirement.
